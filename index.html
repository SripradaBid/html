      <h3>Why Farm Organically?</h3>
      <p>Organic farming promotes the use of crop rotations. Instead of relying on pesticides, organic farmers aim is to create a natural balance between plants and animals to prevent
        pests.</p>

      <h3>Why Buy Organic?</h3>
      <p>Organic foods often have more beneficial nutrients, such as antioxidants, than their conventionally-grown counterparts and people with allergies to foods, chemicals, or preservatives often find their symptoms lessen or go away when they eat
        only organic foods.</p>

      <h3>From Farm To Table</h3>
      <p>Farm-to-table is a social movement which promotes serving local food. The food on the table came directly from a specific farm, without going through a store, market, or distributor along the way. This helps in reduction in the cost of vegetables and fruits.</p>
